### 🧠 The Awareness Framework
My work is guided by the **Observation, Memory, and Pattern (OMP)** triad—a recursive system framework derived from my research into the meaning of consciousness and systemic reality.

- **Perception:** How systems intake data.
- **Memory:** How patterns are stored and refined.
- **Decisions:** How feedback loops shape the reality of the system.
