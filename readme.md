### 🧠 The Awareness Framework
My approach is guided by a recursive system framework derived from my research into the nature of consciousness. It operates on the **OMP (Observation, Memory, and Pattern)** triad:

* **Perception:** High-level conceptual browsing and data intake.
* **Models:** Building systemic representations of reality.
* **Decisions:** Closing the loop through feedback and systemic action.
